# FAQ

**How can I change the bot's prefix?**

- The prefix is defined in the `.env` file.

**Does this bot moderation feature commands like `!purge`, `!kick`, and `!ban`?**

- It does not. This is not quite a moderation/utility bot.

**How can I host my bot when I'm away from my machine, 24/7?**

- For that, you'll need to run the program on a remote machine. You'll need a VPS of your own. [You can get a VPS for less than \$10/month on https://revolt.host/!](https://revolt.host/)

**Where can I donate?**

- You can support [UNDERFORUMS on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/underforums), send tips to my Bitcoin address (`3HFuhH4enDUKFqokiron6jyMSzPVwNHkTW`), or send me [XLM on Keybase (@youngseebi)](https://keybase.io/youngseebi)!
